        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a Food Scientist, having graduated from the Faculty of Nutrition (FANUT) at the Federal University of Mato Grosso (UFMT) in 2015. I completed my Master's degree in Animal Science in 2017 under the guidance of Prof. Eduardo Figueiredo. In 2021, I obtained my Ph.D. in Food Science from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), supervised by Prof. Carlos Conte at the Chemistry Institute (IQ). During my Ph.D., I participated in a sandwich doctoral program at Agriculture and Agri-food Canada and the Government of Alberta, working under the supervision of Dr. Kim Stanford. I have a track record with 48 accepted and/or published scientific articles and have authored 13 conference papers presented at both national and international congresses. Additionally, I have contributed as a reviewer for 17 scientific journals, including The Lancet Microbe. I am also honored to serve on the editorial boards of esteemed journals such as Canadian Journal of Infectious Diseases and Medical Microbiology, Frontiers in Genetics, Frontiers in Microbiology, and Antibiotics.
During my postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Lethbridge, I had the opportunity to share my knowledge as a Guest Professor in the course "Biology 3000," where I taught classes on transcription and regulatory gene control in prokaryotic microorganisms. My expertise lies in Food Microbiology and Food Hygiene. I specialize in evaluating the contamination of meat products by foodborne pathogens, assessing antimicrobial resistance, conducting microbial inactivation using chemical and organic methods, and performing total genetic sequencing of bacteria. My minor skills encompass predictive microbiology, non-thermal inactivation technologies, sensory analysis, and exploring genetic factors related to bacterial stress resistance.</p>
